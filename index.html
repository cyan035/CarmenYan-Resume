        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I am Carmen Yan, a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently in the Pre-Business Administration studying towards my goal of entering the business school at UCR and becoming a business manager. I see myself being a future entrepreneur also because I am a person that loves bubble drinks and would like to create a chain of my own. During my free time, I like to shop, travel around the world and hang out with my friends. I like to explore and try new things everyday. I am spontaneous and outgoing.

When it comes to business management, I have multiple experiences where I was the team lead providing quality customer service. I worked at a bubble tea shop during my Senior Year of high school because I wanted to learn what being in the bubble tea industry was like. I was promoted from a crew member to team lead within 5 months of working there. I learned a lot about designing drinks and promotions to boost the storeâ€™s popularity. I also got to learn what it takes to run a business on a daily basis. With this experience, I am more confident and determined to start my own bubble tea business. 
<br><br>

        During my junior year of high school, I got to work at Chipotle Mexican Grill. This job opportunity allowed me to work with a large chain operation. It allowed me to view running a business from an experienced perspective. This job opportunity helped me understand what it takes to spread franchises between different locations, manage hundreds and thousands of employees, and how to keep your menu desirable. Being a future entrepreneur, this job inspired me to set my goal and to work smart to build up a chain empire.
<br><br>

        When I first got into High School, I got the chance to work at a local Kumon that was near my house. Kumon is a chain tutor company that works with children from P-12. As a part of the crew there, I learned how to provide the basic customer service skills, which later will be a main part of business management. Working with mostly big operations, I got to learn from the experts on how to build up a successful business. Comparing the different operations, I got to list the pros and cons while taking notes on the must and miss.

With the opportunities that were given to me and the learning environment that I stayed in, I was able to plan out what I wanted to do in college. I want to focus on the fields of management and communication. As someone who is spontaneous and outgoing, I want to find ways to provide the future generations a unique way of management that would improve as our world gets more developed. My goal is to start small but also be able to improve the business field so it can become more convenient for everyone. I want to help build connections that allow everyone to be included in the world.
